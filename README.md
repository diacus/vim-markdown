# Vim Markdown

After some years I decided to split up my personal configuration into indivirual
plugins, so they might be shared and maintained easier. This is the markdown
portion.

## Install

I recommend using a plugin manager like vim-plug by {AUTHOR}



```python
from os import path


print(f"Hello from {os.name}")
```
