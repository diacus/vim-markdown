# Vim Markdown

After some years I decided to split up my personal configuration into indivirual
plugins, so they might be shared and maintained easier. This is the markdown
portion.

## Installation

Install it like any other plugin, I recommend using the plugin manager of our
choice. For example `plug.vim` at your `$HOME/.vimrc` add:

```
call plug#begin()
" other plugins...
Plug 'diacus/vim-markdown'
" other plugins...
call plug#end()
```

## Getting help

Once installed, you can see the documentation within the vim's help system

```
:help vim-markdown
```
